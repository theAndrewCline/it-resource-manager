# It Resource Manager

The purpose of this project is to explore a Go and Elm stack.
How does it feel? is it nice? can a junior develop start contributing fast.
Code should be very simple, no complex ideas needed.
Code should be maintainable
Application should be robust. There should be some fault tolerance

## Senario

An IT Support Manager needs to know the computers that he has available

Because it's an aweseome company employee's pick out there machines and parts themeselves

for an MVP we need to create a database for the computers.
A computer should have a name and a list of parts and the name of a person who has the machine.

## Future ideas

- parts should be their own table so they can be tranfered from machine to machine
- there should be a people table so you can assign people to a machine
